## Lazy Loading

Images are the key cause of large page sizes. They are often loaded even when not needed causing page sizes to be bigger than they need to be. This plugin loads images only when the user scrolls to it on the site. This plugin can reduce page load times and bandwidth usage.

## About the plugin

The plugin filters the_content on pages and posts; changing the output of the img tag to work with a third party script.

The plugin only works on the_content and does not work on all images across the site. This is to keep things simple and is usually the main area in which theme developers do not have control over the output.
